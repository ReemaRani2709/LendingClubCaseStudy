## Conclusions
- With increasing interest rate loans are defaulting more in case of lower income group customers
- For higher interest rate, defaulter percentage is increasing in all the loam amount group
- With increasing loan amount, loans are defaulting more in case of lower income group customers
- For lower annual income group, loans are defaulting more in-case of poor grade customers
- Driving factors behind loan defaults are: Lower annual income, high loan amount, high interest rate, poor grade of customer, long term plan  
- Defaulters are negatively correlated with annual income and positively correlated with other attributes and highly correlated with Interest Rate, Term, Grade
